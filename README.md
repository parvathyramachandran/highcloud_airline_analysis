# HighCloud Airline Data Analysis (SQL)

This project performs in-depth SQL analysis on airline operational data to evaluate performance metrics such as load factor, passenger demand, route popularity, and carrier efficiency. The analysis leverages a calendar dimension, time-based aggregations, and business KPIs to support data-driven insights.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains airline flight-level data including:
- Flight dates (Year, Month, Day)
- Transported passengers
- Available seats
- Carrier name
- Route information (From–To City)
- Distance group classification

## Key Analysis Performed
- Created a calendar (date dimension) view for time-based analysis
- Calculated load factor percentages (Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly)
- Analyzed load factor by carrier
- Identified top 10 carriers by passenger preference
- Determined busiest routes based on number of flights
- Compared load factor between weekdays and weekends
- Analyzed number of flights by distance group
